# Development Notes

- I built this project about four months ago when i was building my CyberSafe project and havent touched it since then as i didnt bother to as i thought it turmed out well for a first time project. I'm writing this now because i wanted to clean things up and explain how i did it so i can go back and see how i did it if i want to reflect on my first project.
- The hardest part at the beginning was figuring out how to get the agent and ChatGPT to help me build the phishing simulator. ChatGPT kept telling me to use a Cloudflare Worker, but i had no idea what that even was. I had to read a bunch of random posts and docs online until i finally understood how to set one up which was annoying as i couldnt find it well at the start.
- Once i got the Worker running, i had to pick a model for the ai part. I didn’t want to use something expensive and i talked about this with my mom so we could budget. I compared the prices on the different models. That’s how i found gpt-5 Nano. It was cheap enough and still good for what i needed.
- The first version of the site was built with mkdocs because it’s Python based and just like what i was doing with the CyberSafe site. I was in the middle of learning Python so it was what i wanted as i wanted to learn in the most efficeint way, making something to practice. 
- I ran into problems getting the ai part to work properly. I need to debug this and get it working so people can keep getting random test emails that are different every time. If i had more time, I’d add better reporting and maybe a nicer UI. Right now it’s simple, but it works and it taught me a lot.
- I use this to show seniors examples of the kind of emails they should watch out for. I started with an Amazon one because that is what got my grandma into trouble. (Never click on sketchy links. it never ends well like any modern day game adaptation.)
